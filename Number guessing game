I made two versions of this game.


#Version1 (Asks to guess number only one time.)
from random import*
usernum = eval(input("Enter a number between 1 to 10:"))
compnum = randint(1,10)
if usernum==compnum:
    print("You guessed the right number.Great!!")
else:
    print("oops try again :)")



#Version2 (Asks to guess number until user gets the right number and also tells how high or low they are to the number.)
from random import*
usernum = eval(input("Enter a number between 1 to 10:"))
compnum = randint(1,10)
while usernum!=compnum:
    if usernum>compnum:
        print("try liittle low")
        usernum = eval(input("Enter a number between 1 to 10:"))
    elif usernum<compnum:
        print("try little high")
        usernum = eval(input("Enter a number between 1 to 10:"))
    else:
        break
print("You guessed the right number.")
